      New to SEO? So am I, which is exactly why I built this site. I wanted to create the kind of starting point I wish I had when I first became interested in the field. Rather than spending hours jumping between different courses and articles, my goal is to bring all the essential strategies, key terms, and important ideas together in one place for beginners. If what you find here sparks your interest the way it did for me, I encourage you to dive even deeper into SEO. Along the way, I will also show you how to start your own SEO project from scratch. In a competitive job market, taking these first real steps can authentically help you break into the field, even without professional experience.
