    <h2>Step-by-Step: Your First SEO Project</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Pick Your Platform:</strong><br>
        Choose a website builder that feels comfortable. WordPress is beginner-friendly and has lots of plugins. GitHub Pages is free and great for learning how websites work behind the scenes. There's no perfect choice—just pick what fits your style!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan Your First Page:</strong><br>
        Start small. Pick a topic you care about and that people search for. It could be a one-page guide, a blog post, or a simple tutorial. The key is to make it useful and real—not perfect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do Keyword Research:</strong><br>
        Use free tools like Google Search, Ubersuggest, or AnswerThePublic to find a few long-tail keywords related to your topic. For example, if your topic is "easy plant care," a long-tail keyword might be "how to take care of a snake plant."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Build and Structure Your Page:</strong><br>
        Use your main keyword in the title and headings. Write a clear meta description. Add alt text for images. Make sure your page loads quickly and looks good on phones. Link to other helpful pages if you have them. Keep your writing friendly and focused on solving a real problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Track What's Working:</strong><br>
        Use Google Search Console to see if your page is being found. Look at what keywords people use to find you, and update your content as you learn what works best. Small improvements over time can lead to big growth!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Remember: You don't need to be a pro to get started. Every expert was a beginner once. The most important thing is to take action, learn as you go, and enjoy the process of building something real.
